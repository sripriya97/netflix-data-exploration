# Data Exploration : EDA on Netflix Data from Kaggle

<h3>Aim </h3>
To create visualizations that showcases how content (Movies/TV shows) hosted on Netflix has
progressed over the years. This will tell our users the popularity of content based on their genres and
geography. These insights can help content producers understand their target audience and preferences in
what they consume. Since Netflix is not just a streaming service anymore, but they have also been
producing original content in recent years, our dashboard can thus prove to be instrumental in driving
content that works well with the audience. The dashboard can also help Netflix fine-tune its
recommendations based on trends in content consumption in different consumer segments.

<h3>End-user</h3>
Our main users are Netflix and content producers.
Netflix works closely with its own content producers to make contents that can satisfy subscribers, it also
purchases promising scripts from scriptwriters to enrich its video platform. For content producers, with
our dashboard that contains the trend of popular topics in different districts, they can better know which
kind of topic is in vogue and what kind of story should be designed for different areas. For Netflix, since
it can know the trend, not only can it better know which scripts to purchase, it can also make more profits
with more contents created to suit the tastes of the general public.

<h3>For the purpose of this project we framed 3 hypothesis and answered it using visualizations :</h3>
<h4>Hypothesis 1: More content is added during the Holiday period in the Americas and Europe</h4>
<h4>Hypothesis 2: Western countries produce more mature content in comparison with eastern counties that are more conservative</h4>
<h4>Hypothesis 3: Among all genres for TV Shows, comedies have the highest number of seasons</h4>
